Library to parse the Victron Energy "VE.Direct" protocol and map the data to useful structs with clear units.

Can be used in conjuction with the `serial` library to pull battery status information from devices like the BMV 700, or solar charging data from the Victron's various MPPT solar charge controllers.

## Details

Developed using a VE.Direct to USB interface cable to a BMV 700. Should work identically with any other connection method to the device (such as the VE.Direct to serial adapters)

Cross compiled to use on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Based of the `VE.Direct-Protocol-3.27.pdf`. Lots of relevant infos at https://www.victronenergy.com/support-and-downloads/whitepapers

Currently only implements the "Text-mode" (read only) interface,

> The VE.Direct interface includes two modes: Text-mode and the HEX-mode. The purpose of the Text-mode is to make retrieving information extremely simple. The product will periodically transmit all run-time fields. The HEX-mode allows not only to read data but also write data, for example, change settings.


## Status

Early development.

- [x] Initial protocol parser
- [x] Initial mapping of most useful BMV 700 fields
- [x] More complete testing of parser
- [ ] Mapping of all fields of BMV
- [x] Mapping of all fields for MPPT
- [ ] Mapping of all fields for inverters

## Run examples

Here are a few sample call to run the provided examples.

- cargo run --example read_serial
- cargo run --example serialport -- /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART 19200
